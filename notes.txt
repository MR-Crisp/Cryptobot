need to create a new tab for the overview/ graphs section so that the user can see all of the different profits and losses.

 and then a new tab for the actual live trading.



 logic for the pivots:

  calculate the pivot points from a month before, and then aply it to the month after  

 check if the price is approaching the pivot. wait for it to break the pivot. then set a take profit as well as a stop loss.









 make a tool for the user to change all the variables

 it still trades but the responsibilty is in the users hands

 it reduces the users workload by 90%

 but still leaves all of the main desicion making in the users hands on what variables to use

 the backtesting methods can be a 'sandbox/ playground' wich allow the user to test thier variables. and then maybe use them in the real version.
